          Tolerant Futures
          through
          Ancient Identities

      <p class="f4">This education resource has been designed as part of the Co-producing Tolerant Futures through Ancient Identities project, funded by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC). The project is led by the University of Edinburgh in partnership with Durham University with input from nine heritage museums and sites across Britain.</p>

      <p>Co-Producing Tolerant Futures aims to expose and challenge divisive uses of the Iron Age, Roman and Early Medieval past uncovered during the Ancient Identities in Modern Britain project (2016-2019, AHRC-funded). Findings from this project showed that the Iron Age and Roman periods are often presented through dichotomies and exaggerated caricatures in formal and free-choice learning environments in Britain. The research also suggested that, later on in their adult life, people draw on these early impressions and dualistic understandings of the past to justify antagonism towards particular groups defined on the basis of ethnicity, culture and race.</p>

      <p>Co-Producing Tolerant Futures through Ancient Identities challenges these uses by developing education training resources to promote more nuanced and less binary interpretation of the Iron Age and Roman past at heritage venues and in primary school classrooms. </p>
